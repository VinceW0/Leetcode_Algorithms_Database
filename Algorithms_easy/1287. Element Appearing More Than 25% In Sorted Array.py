1287. EGiven an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time.

Return that integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5lement Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array
